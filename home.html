            The goal of this project was to get more comfortable with React 
            by creating a list interface. We could choose any theme for the site, but it had to be a list of anything that aggregates for a 
            purpose. The theme I chose was celebrities.

          <p>
            Another limitation that may have affected the results was the sheer amount of
             data, or rather, the lack thereof. Normally, analysis requires more than 20 data points to form a 
             conclusion or generalize a trend. However, in this project, the amount of data collected was much 
             smaller than what may be required to conduct accurate statistical tests. 
          </p>
          <p>My results speak to the fact that at times, it’s very hard to determine, with high accuracy, which design is
             better. This comes from the fact that even though the design may be better suited to a user, or task, sometimes 
             it’s hard to quantify these differences in a statistically significant or meaningful way. </p>
