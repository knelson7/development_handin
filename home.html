            The goal of this project was to get more comfortable with React 
            by creating a list interface. We could choose any theme for the site, but it had to be a list of anything that aggregates for a 
            purpose. The theme that I chose was celebrities. The basic website that I created models a voting page, in which users can vote for their 
            favorite celebrity.

        <div>
         <p>Users can vote for a celebrity or multiple celebrities of their choice. If they make a mistake, users also have the option to 
           delete a vote as well. When the users click on the vote button, that celebrity's individual vote count goes up as well as the total 
           count. Lastly, the user can reset the vote counts with the "Reset all Votes" button. 
         </p>
         <p>
           Other functionality of the website include sorting and filtering. There are two filtering options and one sorting feature. 
           Users can help find specific celebrities faster by filtering by profession or by gender. Depending on what filters 
           they have selected, only celebrities that fall under those categories will be shown. Additionally, the user can sort 
           by highest to lowest user rating.

         This project was incredibly rewarding as I'd never used Javascript or React before. I found certain elements of Javascript, 
         such as dealing with the combination of html and logic based code, to be difficult, but I really got to see the 
         robustness and incredible functionality that the language offers through this project.
